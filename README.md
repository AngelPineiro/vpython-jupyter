# VPython Binder with Seaborn module support

See [here](https://github.com/BruceSherwood/vpython-jupyter) for the original source from which this version was forked.  
I made this fork to try with adding seaborn module for plotting. Only changes were adding `seaborn` and some other plotting-related modules to `requirements.txt`, updating this `README` file, and editing the repo description line to be 'VPython running in a Jupyter notebook --> ADDED SEABORN in this fork'. 

See about using notebooks spawned from this version [here](http://roughdraft.io/8464566df91a757271861b9224902edb).
