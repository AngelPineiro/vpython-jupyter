# VPython Binder with Seaborn module support

See [here](https://github.com/BruceSherwood/vpython-jupyter) for the original source from which this version was forked.  
I made this fork to try with adding seaborn module for plotting. Only changes were adding `seaborn` to `requirements.txt`, updating this `README` file, and editing the repo description line to be `VPython running in a Jupyter notebook --> ADDED SEABORN in this fork`. 

See about using notebooks spawned from this version [here](http://draft.sx/8464566df91a757271861b9224902edb) or [here](http://roughdraft.io/8464566df91a757271861b9224902edb). (Those are just different viewers displaying the same document. Pick the style you like best.)
